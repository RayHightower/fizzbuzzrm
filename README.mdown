FizzBuzz for RubyMotion
===

This is a simple, bare-bones RubyMotion app used to demo the following
in my introductory RubyMotion presentations:

* Using RubyMotion with Xcode's Interface Builder
* TDD with RubyMotion's RSpec clone, MacBacon

Slides for the presentation can be found at [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/search?q=rayhightower).

Videos and other RubyMotion info will be posted at [RayHightower.com](http://rayhightower.com) as the info becomes available.
